// At School of Code, we have an Energiser activity around 3pm. Yesterday, we played table tennis... on the floor.
// If there are 23 people on the course, everyone had a certain number of turns, and the total match time was totalTime seconds, write a function to show how long each person had with the paddle, to the next second, based on number of turns.

//Solution
function turnTime(turns, totalTime) {}

module.exports = { turnTime };
